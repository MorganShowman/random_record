# Random Record #
## A Story ##
Once upon a time, there was a Rails developer called Tyler.
Tyler was growing tiresome of having to constantly find new IDs to use
when testing his prettyfrickinsweetandawesome method `#awesome_sauce!`.
This was no small matter for Tyler. After all, his new method was pretty
frickin sweet AND awesome. But just the thought of having to find a
record he hadn't tested on before made Tyler cringe.

Then one day when Tyler was almost done testing his new emaculant method
he had an idea.

> Why not create a method that will give me a different record
everytime?!?!

Tyler was estatic.

> Brilliant!

He thought.

> Let's make it a gem!

So Tyler set to work, a short time later he'd produced his first ever
gem.

Here it is, straight from the most briliant hands of Tyler. I present to
you, Random Record!

## Usage ##
```ruby
gem 'random_record', :git => 'git@github.com:sqm/random_record.git'
```

and use like this!

```ruby
TurboActiveRecordModel.random.awesome_sauce!

> "This is the coolest most pretty frickin sweet method ever!"
```
